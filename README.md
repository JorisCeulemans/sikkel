# Sikkel

Sikkel is an Agda library that allows a user to program in multimode simple type theories.
It uses a deeply embedded language that is parametrized by a mode theory (specifying the available modes and modalities) and that can be easily extended with additional type and term constructors, thus supporting a wide variety of type theories.
Moreover, Sikkel has a type checker that is sound by construction in the sense that all well-typed programs are automatically translated to their semantics in a shallow embedding based on presheaf models.
Additionally, our model supports combining different base categories by using modalities to transport definitions between them.
This enables in particular a general approach for extracting definitions to the meta-level, so that we can use the extended type theories to define regular Agda functions and prove properties of them.

For an overview of the MSFP paper "Sikkel: Multimode Simple Type Theory as an Agda Library" together with the relevant code, we refer to the file [README.agda](README.agda).

## Installation

Sikkel requires Agda 2.6.2 and the Agda standard library (version 1.7).
To use the library in your Agda development, perform
```
git clone https://github.com/JorisCeulemans/sikkel.git
```
and add the path to Sikkel to the `libraries` file in your `AGDA_DIR` (see https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2/tools/package-system.html for more info).
You can then add a `.agda-lib` file to your project containing
```
depend: sikkel
```
which will allow you to use Sikkel.


## Overview of this Repository

* The deeply embedded syntactic layer can be found in the MSTT directory, together with the sound type checker.
* The formalization of presheaf models is located in the folder Model.
* Extracting shallowly embedded terms in the model to Agda programs is implemented in the file Extraction.agda.
* We have worked out two use cases of Sikkel: guarded recursive type theory and parametricity. They can be found in the directory Applications.
